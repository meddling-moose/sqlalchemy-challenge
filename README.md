# sqlalchemy-challenge

This challenge really pushed me to get better at problem-solving and not just asking questions and getting answers. While I will say I am not great at that, I feel this time, I did better.

SQLalchemy and Flask are both tools that I have not used before. The syntax of sqlalchemy was frustrating at times with how precise I needed to be, but for such a powerful tool that binds many flavors of sql together, I can understand.

Flask was pretty straightforward although the jsonify library confused me. It's confusing why some data structures are able to be jsonified, and others need to be manipulated to be okay. It seems like something that will get more understandable with practice.

As always, got my data and starter code from from UCB Extension Datascience bootcamp class
